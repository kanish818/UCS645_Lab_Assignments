# Lab 1 : Send Recieve Basics

1. Implemented Send_Recv Program to send and recive data between parrallely executiong processes.
2. A PingPong Program, where processes send and recive as the counter becomes odd and even after each iteration. (Tried Visualising it also, but  didin't work as expected).
3. Probing and Status checking in MPI.
4. Random walking program.


## TODO:
